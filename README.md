## Intro

Covid-19 is a live global case that fetches information using API displaying Confirmed cases of Uninfected, infected, and Deaths. The information is displayed in a bar graph & line graph. You can also select other countries aside from global cases.

Specific features include:

- API fetching from "https://covid19.mathdro.id/api"
- Can select either global or countries for corona cases
